# Smooth-Particle-Hydrodynamics

Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics is a relatively new numerical method for the simulation of fluid flows relying on kernel interpolation of lagrangian data points we call particles. This code is a matlab implementation of the DualSPHysics code for quick testing of new features. Surface Tension was added to the model in order to capture micro-fluid behavior in lower gravity environments, where these forces dominate.
